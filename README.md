`@gramovie` is a [Telegram's](https://telegram.org/) bot to look and automatically download files from different torrent sources. As soon as it is uploaded to a source, get the file information in your phone, and if you want, start the download right away. Probably it will never be available on Telegram's store. So far, its only source is YTS.

## Installation
Just run `npm install` to install every dependency.

## Run
To compile and use it, just run `npm start` from the terminal.
